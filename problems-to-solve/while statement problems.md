# Python — `while` Loop Practice

---

## Core Thinking Skill for While Loop

> A while loop runs **until a condition changes**.

So always ask:

1. What is the starting condition?
2. What changes inside the loop?
3. When should the loop stop?

---

## 1️⃣ Sum until user enters zero

Keep asking the user to input numbers.

Stop when the user enters `0`.

Print the total sum.

---

## 2️⃣ Count digits of a number

Input a number.

Use a `while` loop to count how many digits it has.

(No string conversion allowed.)

---

## 3️⃣ Reverse a number using while

Input a number.

Reverse it using a `while` loop.

Example:

```
Input: 1234
Output: 4321
```

---

## 4️⃣ Keep asking password until correct

Correct password = `"python123"`

Keep asking user input until correct password is entered.

Print `"Access Granted"`.

---

## 5️⃣ Find factorial using while

Input `n`.

Calculate `n!` using a `while` loop.

---

## 6️⃣ Check if a number is palindrome

Input a number.

Reverse using while and check if same.

Print Yes or No.

---

## 7️⃣ Sum of digits until single digit (digital root)

Input a number.

Keep summing digits repeatedly until only one digit remains.

Example:

```
9875 → 9+8+7+5 = 29 → 2+9 = 11 → 1+1 = 2
```

Output: `2`

---

## 8️⃣ Multiplication table generator with condition

Input a number.

Print multiplication table **until product exceeds 100**.

Stop early when it crosses 100.

---

## 9️⃣ Guess the number game (logic)

Secret number = 27.

Keep asking user guesses until correct.

Print number of attempts taken.

---

## 🔟 Count how many divisors a number has

Input `n`.

Count total divisors using `while`.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Check prime number using while

Input `n`.

Determine whether it is prime using a `while` loop.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Fibonacci series using while

Input `n`.

Print first `n` Fibonacci numbers using while.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Largest digit in a number

Input a number.

Find the largest digit using while.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Keep entering numbers until negative appears

Keep taking numbers.

Stop when user enters a negative number.

Print:

* sum
* average
* count

(Do not include the negative number.)

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Armstrong number check using while

Input a number.

Check if it is an Armstrong number using while.

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Loan repayment simulation

Input:

* loan amount
* monthly payment

Each month subtract payment.

Count how many months needed until loan becomes ≤ 0.

Use while.

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Collatz sequence (intellect challenge)

Input a number `n`.

Rules:

* If even → n = n / 2
* If odd → n = 3n + 1

Continue until n becomes 1.

Print number of steps taken.

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ Pattern using nested while

Input `n`.

Print:

```
1
22
333
4444
```

(for n = 4)

Use nested while loops.

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ Menu-driven calculator

Show menu repeatedly:

```
1 Add
2 Subtract
3 Multiply
4 Exit
```

Keep running until user chooses Exit.

Use while loop.

---

## 2️⃣0️⃣ Logical challenge — longest increasing streak from user input

Keep taking numbers until user enters 0.

Find the longest continuous increasing streak.

Example:

```
Input: 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 1 0
Answer: 4
```
